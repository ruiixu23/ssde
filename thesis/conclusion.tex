This work examines the problem of state and parameter estimation in deterministic and random dynamical systems given noisy, sparse or even incomplete observations.
A mean-field Laplace approximation solution is proposed to address the intractability of the posterior distribution and has been shown empirically to be robust and scalable.
Further, it relaxes the structural assumption imposed on the dynamical systems from previous work and introduces positivity constraints on the states and parameters.
Based on the correspondence between RODEs and SDEs, a highly efficient parallel inference technique is devised to address problems involving diffusion processes.
